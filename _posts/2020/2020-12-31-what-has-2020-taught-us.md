The year 2020 for sure has been tough for all of us. Lots of people have died due to COVID-19. Many have lost their jobs. Though such pandemics have happened in the past, for a lot of people, this was one hell of an experience that they lived through. Lots of lessons.

But we have survived. We thrived. We have proved, once again, that humans are highly adaptable. We have quickly adapted to work remotely. Students have learned to attend classes remotely.  People have found ways to contain the virus and avoid spreading it too much and eventually found the vaccine so that we can fight well with the virus. I’m confident, pretty soon, we’ll beat the virus and will be fully clean again.

This reminds the same thing that we know and heard many times.

But the pains were enormous. The loss is real and people will suffer for years and years. 2020 will be remembered forever by all the people who survived this. Apart from being adaptable, what else should we learn from this year?

 * Be prepared for future pandemics. I’m super surprised why the world wasn’t so less prepared when people like Bill Gates and Barack Obama have already [warned us](https://www.ted.com/talks/bill_gates_the_next_outbreak_we_re_not_ready?language=en) that we’re less prepared? 
 * Figure out how we can cut down the delays in vaccine inventions and approvals.
 * Educate the people about Viruses, precautions that need to be taken, etc. It’s a shame that a lot of people didn’t want to wear masks even while witnessing such brutal impacts due to COVID-19.
 * Figure out better supply chain and systems for vaccine distribution. One of my good friends is building [StaTwig](https://www.linkedin.com/company/statwig/) to help with this problem.
 * Overall, improve the health care systems across the world to be better prepared to address pandemics.

What else do you think we should learn from this? What should we fix? You can reply to me on [my twitter](https://twitter.com/buchireddy)
