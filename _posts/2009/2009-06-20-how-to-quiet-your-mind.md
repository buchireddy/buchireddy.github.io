I have been going through [Think Simple Now](http://thinksimplenow.com/) recently and I found the posts really awesome. There is so much you can learn from them. To take a sample look at this post.  

[How to Quiet Your Mind](http://thinksimplenow.com/clarity/how-to-quiet-your-mind/)

And the following lines are really the ones that change your life if you are willing to follow them

- Say what you mean. Mean what you say.
- Don’t say to anyone unless you can say to everyone.
- Don’t say inside, what you cannot say outside.
- Don’t say unless it is true, useful or kind.

I have decided to follow them right on and quiet my mind. What about you??
