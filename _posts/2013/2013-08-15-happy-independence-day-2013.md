My country was the mother of history;
The grandmother of legend, and tradition.

Life was glorious,
In the land of vedas.

But the enemies captured it;
And looted the fabulous wealth.

People have struggled,
To fight for my country.

People have laid down their lives,
To free my mother land.

My people woke up with life and freedom,
On one historical day.

Let every patriot be honored;
Without them, freedom would have died.

Enjoy the colorful life,
In this independent country.

But oh boy! Take the pledge,
That you work to rebuild our nation.

In an effort to repay them.
And fulfill their dreams.
