Well, it’s been some time since I wrote something here. Sometimes life gets busier and you don’t find time for your hobbies.  Now, not just to write something here, but to share my intense feelings, I’ve decided to write few words here.

Have you read the book  **[Ignited Minds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignited_Minds)**, written by scientist Dr APJ Abdul Kalam, formerly the president of India? (I just recall that this book was presented by Mr Gopal Krishna Murthy, Director of ACE Institute, to me when I had secured the top rank in CSE GATE 2007).

Here is an excerpt from wikipedia about this book.

_Dr. Kalam has dedicated_ _**Ignited Minds** to a high school child, named Snehal Thakkar, whom he met at a school, and while talking to the students, a question had come up: “Who is our enemy?”. Kalam recalled that many answers came up, but the answer on which all agreed came from her (Snehal Thakkar): “Our enemy is poverty”._

It’s nice that a school girl could point out the actual enemy of our nation but it’s very sad that we’re unable to win that enemy. Though I am not aware of many wars against this enemy (may be I don’t know ’em), I don’t see many in the recent years. (Of course there are some movies like Bharateeyudu, Tagore, etc which show us a leader who alone fights against corruption and changes the complete nation. But, unfortunately that never happen in reality).

Did you ever think why poverty is our enemy? Okay, did you ever think why can’t we win poverty?  Don’t we have enough resources in India?  Don’t we have talented people in our nation with 120 Cr people? There might be lot of factors which pull us back from winning poverty but the greatest obstacle in my opinion is corruption in India.

We generally have long discussions with our friends and colleagues about corruption in India. We come across news about how much each of our politician is earning and it’s a known fact that whole lot of those earnings are illegal. But, we take it for granted that we can’t help with this. We convince ourselves that this is inevitable in India and we’ve no energy to fight against it. And some people go to the extent that they don’t like India for this and they want to settle down in other countries 🙂  I think we should fight against corruption, not leave this great nation surrendering to bloody corruption.

There are people in this country who own (illegal) properties equal to a state’s budget. There are people who earned (illegally) the amount that is enough to educate crores of poor students. And, according to some latest news, **_Swiss bank balance of Indians is 13 times our country’s debt_**. 

I feel sad that most of us just read these news, feel angry about those politicians who are responsible for this corruption, takes a hasty decision that I should not vote for this leader in the coming elections, but finally feel helpless about the situation and get back to the works silently. Yes, people are actually ready to fight against corruption but they need some great leader/initiator. I am one among those kind of people and I feel bad that we could not initiate a movement against corruption.

Guys, I am really happy that there are few people who are fighting against corruption India. And, I am really delighted to see that it’s happening recently through **[Anna Hazare!!!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Hazare)** The name which has been popping up in headlines of all news papers.  A notable personality about whom the whole India is talking recently.  He is on fast unto death to fight against the enemy of India. I salute you Mr Anna Hazare. I salute for your initiation. That is what people were lacking all these days.

Now that a great leader has initiated a movement against corruption, let us all join hands together to join that movement. Let’s spread this movement rapidly through all possible ways. May it be through emails, may it be through SMS. May it be through your social networking site in which you spend most of your free time. It can be even through a word of mouth when none of the above ways work.

Good to see that many people throughout the country already joined Anna. I see that most of us share mail threads about Hazare. People are creating awareness about Jan Lokpal bill which is aimed at eliminating roots of corruption. People started showing their support to Anna and expressing their anger towards corrupted politicians in different ways. Some people printed currency notes worth Zero to fight against corruption. Some are writing “Meera Netha Chor Hai” on their hands and tea shirts to fight against bad politicians (I guess this is the idea of [**Chetan Bhagat,**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chetan_Bhagat) a novelist, Five point someone fame).

It’s high time we have to fight against corruption in India. Let’s all support Anna Hazare so that Jan Lokpal bill gets passed. Why wait till another Anna comes to fight against corruption? I know people are delighted about the recent cricket world cup win but I’m pretty sure that we would be hundred times happier if India becomes corruption free country. If people think that India, having 120 Cr people with abundant talent, should win cricket world cup, it’s equally important that we all fight corruption and we should gift a corruption free country to our youngsters and kick away our enemies like poverty.

I give my full support to Anna and looking for all the ways to fight corruption. What about you?
