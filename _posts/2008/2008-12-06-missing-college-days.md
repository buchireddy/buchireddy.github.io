Now I’m in corporate world with hectic schedule and wonderful facilities. But, the most important thing in the life is missing. That’s fun!!
Going back to those college days, where we had a wonderful time with friends, bunking off classes, playing computer games, successive movie shows in hostel, those late night riding’s in campus… its not possible to forget them all.
I remember, we used to circulate a message in the final year saying “one day everyone will be busy with their works and will think of the college days and about the friends who’ve created small memories in their mind for some time. Then you’ll get back to the work. Thanks to all those friends who’ve created those memories..”
I remember that message and I’m feeling the truth in that now.

Really missing the college days and my friends a lot.. 😦
