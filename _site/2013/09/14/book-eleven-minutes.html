          <h2>Review of the book "Eleven Minutes"</h2>

<div class="post">
<p>Having read Paulo Coelho’s other books like “The Alchemist” and “Manuscript found in Accra”, I knew that his work won’t disappoint me. “Eleven Minutes” was yet another interesting read from Coelho which was totally gripping till the end.</p>

<p>This book is about a young lady, Maria, who is like every other village girl, to start with, dreaming about future and hoping to have luxuries in life. Only after leaving home, she comes to the realization that life’s full adventures and one should know to how to face and embrace them. She thinks love does’t like her and isn’t for her in this life. She decides to become a prostitute under some circumstances. Like most of the prostitutes, sex is just a job for her, neither enjoying it nor wishing for it. But she meets a young man, with whom she falls in love, realizes that love has its true meaning when you give it the complete freedom. You must read this book to see how beautifully this part was presented.</p>

<p>Coelho certainly knows life and very well knows how to make the reader understand about it. He seems to have done quite some research on sex and he was successful, to some extent, in showing that making love is sacred. The excerpts presented from Maria’s diary are really good.</p>

<p>I really liked the fact that Paulo Coelho wrote this book from a real story. I would recommend to read this book, not to understand about sex, but to understand the adventures of life, what runs in the minds of sex workers, why love is not all about sex though it’s a vital part 🙂</p>
