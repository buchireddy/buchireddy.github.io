<p>Now I‚Äôm in corporate world with hectic schedule and wonderful facilities. But, the most important thing in the life is missing. That‚Äôs fun!!
Going back to those college days, where we had a wonderful time with friends, bunking off classes, playing computer games, successive movie shows in hostel, those late night riding‚Äôs in campus‚Ä¶ its not possible to forget them all.
I remember, we used to circulate a message in the final year saying ‚Äúone day everyone will be busy with their works and will think of the college days and about the friends who‚Äôve created small memories in their mind for some time. Then you‚Äôll get back to the work. Thanks to all those friends who‚Äôve created those memories..‚Äù
I remember that message and I‚Äôm feeling the truth in that now.</p>

<p>Really missing the college days and my friends a lot.. üò¶</p>
