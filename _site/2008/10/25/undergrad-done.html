<p>Well the time has come for me to step out of my college into this world. I’m done with my under graduation :)) A little happy to say, but a lot more unhappy for leaving a student life and the fun in it. And a bit tensed about what and how to do the things in future. Till now it was just for an exam or a programming contest, we were working hardly. Now its time to drive life through more hurdles. Let’s say cheers to our journey and hope we succeed.</p>
