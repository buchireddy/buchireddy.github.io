If you think a bit deeper, the ultimate truth, the quote drives home , is the craving of an individual to be appreciated for what he is and who he is. If someone likes us naturally without any effort on our part, they are indirectly appreciating our very natural personality, our inbuilt talents and our inherent charm. Is there a better a gift than that pristine appreciation ?</p>

<p>All our life, every single day, we work hard just to receive the praise of our superiors. In school, we slogged through all the boring courses, just because we wanted to receive that pat from your dad when you secured the coveted 1st rank. We showed sincerity, hid our mischief and laziness just to be in the good eyes of the teacher. This thing does not end there. Once you start to work, your top most priority is to impress your boss. I wonder if even 10% of the people on this earth, actually enjoy their work. Every day, we forcefully get out of our bed and get to our ‘boot-licking’ job. In a way , all along, we’ve been killing a part of our personality gradually, to this crazy ‘craving for appreciation’. Imagine getting all of this for free without sacrificing yourself. Probably, it is this free gift that is generally termed LOVE.</p>

<p>I do not want this gift of appreciation, if it is for the laurels I’ve achieved or the grades I’ve secured. I want to be appreciated for my laziness , for my dont-care attitude, for my irresponsible behavior, for all my thoughts and words, for my sensitive, caring and emotional heart , for my natural smile, for my over-weight body and for the child that still lives in me. I want to be appreciated for who I am , not How I am.</p>

<p>If you haven’t received that gift yet, you have something to really hope for and look forward to in your life. Iam writing this post, on my flight back to India, travelling to meet my loved ones, and when there is heavy turbulence all around… Truly speaking, that gift of appreciation never made more sense …</p>
