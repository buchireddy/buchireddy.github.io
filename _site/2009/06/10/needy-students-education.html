          <h2>Intelligent minds with no encouragement ‚Äì Let‚Äôs help them</h2>

<div class="post">
<p>In the recently out SSC results, three students from *Z. P. High Schools* have scored very good marks and stood at top ranks at mandal level. But sad thing is their parents are not here to feel happy about their achievement and none to help them to continue their studies. To take a sample, one student‚Äôs mother and father committed suicide few years back because of agricultural losses and he doesn‚Äôt even have grand parents. His kind hearted aunt‚Äôs family was looking after him and made him to study in the government school.</p>

<p>Luckily, Sri Chaitanya Junior College‚Äôs management has accepted to give them free residential &amp; inter education for two years, except that each one should pay a minimum amount of 13,000 Rs (thanks a lot to B. S Rao for offering free education to 100 orphan students) for books, hostel deposit, pocket money and other miscellaneous charges. But they don‚Äôt have money to buy their clothes at least.</p>

<p>These are the details of the students.<br />
Yeldhandi Raji Reddy</p>

<p>Mother &amp; Father committed suicide. Hall Ticket No:28138802 Marks:538/600<br />
Aadepu Sathish</p>

<p>Mother and father committed suicide. Hall Ticket No:28143904 Marks:549/600</p>

<p>Panyala Madhusudhan</p>

<p>Father committed suicide. Hall Ticket No:28135582 Marks:508/600</p>

<p>Let me clarify a thing that scoring 500+ by studying in a govt school is really a great achievement (I know it very well as I am from govt school). Thinking of these boys, me and my friends wanted to do something for them.</p>

<p>At first, we thought of giving some money (what we can give) and leave other things to god. Obviously smaller amount can‚Äôt make anything for them. Why to help them partially? Why to leave things to god? Why don‚Äôt we try to help them completely? Got an idea. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs request help from all our friends and there‚Äôs little hope that it helps‚Äù. I have come across few mails asking for this kind of help previously. Though I‚Äôm interested to help the needy, I didn‚Äôt help because of many thoughts in my mind like, is the case genuine? Are they really in need? Is the money properly used? This time I don‚Äôt want others to think like this, when I ask for help.</p>

<p>We sent a mail to all the friends and colleagues seeking help to educate these guys. Amazingly, the response was awesome. I should personally thank all those from D. E. Shaw, for keeping belief in me and helping these poor guys. We were really happy. Finally they are into the college life.</p>

<p>We might have achieved many things in our life, but the greatest pleasure is when you save someone‚Äôs life. Though we didn‚Äôt save a life, I felt happy because the intelligent minds are not going waste (I have seen couple of cases in my village, but I was helpless at that time). Let‚Äôs hope that these boys continue their good work, proving all those who helped them as correct and reach to top positions. üôÇ</p>
